<h1>Shinto, Buddhism and the Japanese belief system</h1>
<p class="intro">
<p class="intro">Religion in Japan is a wonderful mish-mash of ideas from Shintoism and Buddhism. Unlike in the West, religion in Japan is rarely preached, nor is it a doctrine. Instead it is a moral code, a way of living, almost indistinguishable from Japanese social and cultural values. </P>
<p class="intro">Japanese religion is also a private, family affair. It is separate from the state; there are no religious prayers or symbols in a school graduation ceremony, for example. Religion is&nbsp;rarely discussed in every day life and the majority of Japanese do not worship regularly or claim to be religious. </P>
<p class="intro">However, most people turn to religious rituals in birth, marriage and death and take part in spiritual <EM>matsuri</EM> (or festivals) throughout the year.</P>
